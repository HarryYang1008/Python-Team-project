    "### Survey Questions and Scores\n",
    "The main idea of the survey is to track whether the company's efforts in improving DEI actually work and to discover if any group(coming from different backgrounds such as different gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation etc.) falls behind. The survey can be repeated periodically to measure the impact of the company's efforts.\n",

    "There are 5 survey questions for each of the DEI categories. Survey scores of employees are also shown in the data set."
